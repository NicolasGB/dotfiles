# The font families to use.
# 
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
# 
#     ghostty +list-fonts
# 
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
# 
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
# 
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
# 
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
# 
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
# 
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
# 
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
# 
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.

# A theme to use. This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme
# name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file. Ghostty also supports
# specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode. Each
# option is documented below.
# 
# If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that
# file as a theme. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error
# will be logged and no other directories will be searched.
# 
# If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be
# searched for a file name that matches the theme. This is case sensitive on
# systems with case-sensitive filesystems. It is an error for a theme name to
# include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.
# 
# The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty
# configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes` or
# `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
# 
# The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources
# directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed
# into this directory. On macOS, this list is in the
# `Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this
# list is in the `share/ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the
# Ghostty "share" directory.
# 
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
# 
# A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file. They share
# the same syntax and same configuration options. A theme can set any valid
# configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted
# source. The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration
# options.
# 
# Some options cannot be set within theme files. The reason these are not
# supported should be self-evident. A theme file cannot set `theme` or
# `config-file`. At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any
# warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will
# be silently ignored.
# 
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
# 
# To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following
# syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`. For example:
# `light:Rose Pine Dawn,dark:Rose Pine`. Whitespace around all values are
# trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter. Both light and dark
# must be specified in this form. In this form, the theme used will be
# based on the current desktop environment theme.
# 
# There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming. These will
# be fixed in a future update:
# 
#   - macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.

# Color palette for the 256 color form that many terminal applications use.
# The syntax of this configuration is `N=COLOR` where `N` is 0 to 255 (for
# the 256 colors in the terminal color table) and `COLOR` is a typical RGB
# color code such as `#AABBCC` or `AABBCC`, or a named X11 color. For example,
# `palette = 5=#BB78D9` will set the 'purple' color.
# 
# The palette index can be in decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal.
# Decimal is assumed unless a prefix is used: `0b` for binary, `0o` for octal,
# and `0x` for hexadecimal.
# 
# For definitions on the color indices and what they canonically map to,
# [see this cheat sheet](https://www.ditig.com/256-colors-cheat-sheet).

# The command to run, usually a shell. If this is not an absolute path, it'll

# 
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
# 
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with. If additional
# arguments are provided, the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`
# to offload shell argument expansion.
# 
# To avoid shell expansion altogether, prefix the command with `direct:`, e.g.
# `direct:nvim foo`. This will avoid the roundtrip to `/bin/sh` but will also
# not support any shell parsing such as arguments with spaces, filepaths with
# `~`, globs, etc. (Available since: 1.2.0)
# 
# You can also explicitly prefix the command with `shell:` to always wrap the

# This command will be used for all new terminal surfaces, i.e. new windows,

# 
# Ghostty supports the common `-e` flag for executing a command with

# This flag sets the `initial-command` configuration, see that for more
# information.
command = /opt/homebrew/bin/nu

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values. The list of actions is available in
# the documentation or using the `ghostty +list-actions` command.
# 
# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`.
# 
# If the key is a single Unicode codepoint, the trigger will match
# any presses that produce that codepoint. These are impacted by
# keyboard layouts. For example, `a` will match the `a` key on a
# QWERTY keyboard, but will match the `q` key on a AZERTY keyboard
# (assuming US physical layout).
# 
# For Unicode codepoints, matching is done by comparing the set of
# modifiers with the unmodified codepoint. The unmodified codepoint is
# sometimes called an "unshifted character" in other software, but all
# modifiers are considered, not only shift. For example, `ctrl+a` will match
# `a` but not `ctrl+shift+a` (which is `A` on a US keyboard).
# 
# Further, codepoint matching is case-insensitive and the unmodified
# codepoint is always case folded for comparison. As a result,
# `ctrl+A` configured will match when `ctrl+a` is pressed. Note that
# this means some key combinations are impossible depending on keyboard
# layout. For example, `ctrl+_` is impossible on a US keyboard because
# `_` is `shift+-` and `ctrl+shift+-` is not equal to `ctrl+_` (because
# the modifiers don't match!). More details on impossible key combinations
# can be found at this excellent source written by Qt developers:
# https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qkeysequence.html#keyboard-layout-issues
# 
# Physical key codes can be specified by using any of the key codes
# as specified by the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/).
# For example, `KeyA` will match the physical `a` key on a US standard
# keyboard regardless of the keyboard layout. These are case-sensitive.
# 
# For aesthetic reasons, the w3c codes also support snake case. For
# example, `key_a` is equivalent to `KeyA`. The only exceptions are
# function keys, e.g. `F1` is `f1` (no underscore). This is a consequence
# of our internal code using snake case but is purposely supported
# and tested so it is safe to use. It allows an all-lowercase binding
# which I find more aesthetically pleasing.
# 
# Function keys such as `insert`, `up`, `f5`, etc. are also specified
# using the keys as specified by the previously linked W3C specification.
# 
# Physical keys always match with a higher priority than Unicode codepoints,
# so if you specify both `a` and `KeyA`, the physical key will always be used
# regardless of what order they are configured.
# 
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
# 
# Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
# modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
# that Ghostty uses.
# 
# Some additional notes for triggers:
# 
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
# 
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
# 
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
# 
# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
# sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
# `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
# user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
# is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
# is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
# 
# Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
# in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
# 
# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
# 
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
#     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
#     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
#     specifically output that key (e.g. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
#     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
# 
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
#     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
#     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
#     will do nothing.
# 
#   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
#     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
#     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
# 
#   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
#     triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
# 
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
# 
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
# 
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable. Unbind will remove any matching trigger,
#     including `physical:`-prefixed triggers without specifying the
#     prefix.
# 
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. e.g. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
# 
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. e.g. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
# 
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     e.g. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
# 
#   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the
#     `ghostty +list-actions` command.
# 
# Some notes for the action:
# 
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
# 
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
# 
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
# 
# The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change
# the behavior of the keybind. These are:
# 
#  * `all:`
# 
#    Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
#    keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
#    then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
#    applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
#    are already global (e.g. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.
# 
#    Available since: 1.0.0
# 
#  * `global:`
# 
#    Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work within Ghostty
#    and under the right conditions (application focused, sometimes terminal
#    focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work globally across your system
#    (e.g. even when Ghostty is not focused), specify this prefix.
#    This prefix implies `all:`.
# 
#    Note: this does not work in all environments; see the additional notes
#    below for more information.
# 
#    Available since: 1.0.0 on macOS, 1.2.0 on GTK
# 
#  * `unconsumed:`
# 
#    Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind will consume the input,
#    meaning that the associated encoding (if any) will not be sent to the
#    running program in the terminal. If you wish to send the encoded value
#    to the program, specify the `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire
#    keybind. For example: `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`. `global:` and
#    `all:`-prefixed keybinds will always consume the input regardless of
#    this setting. Since they are not associated with a specific terminal
#    surface, they're never encoded.
# 
#    Available since: 1.0.0
# 
#  * `performable:`
# 
#    Only consume the input if the action is able to be performed.
#    For example, the `copy_to_clipboard` action will only consume the input
#    if there is a selection to copy. If there is no selection, Ghostty
#    behaves as if the keybind was not set. This has no effect with `global:`
#    or `all:`-prefixed keybinds. For key sequences, this will reset the
#    sequence if the action is not performable (acting identically to not
#    having a keybind set at all).
# 
#    Performable keybinds will not appear as menu shortcuts in the
#    application menu. This is because the menu shortcuts force the
#    action to be performed regardless of the state of the terminal.
#    Performable keybinds will still work, they just won't appear as
#    a shortcut label in the menu.
# 
#    Available since: 1.1.0
# 
# Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
# `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
# set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
# `global:` keybind will be used.
# 
# Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
# `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
# and not consume the input to reload the config.
# 
# Note: `global:` is only supported on macOS and certain Linux platforms.
# 
# On macOS, this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted
# to Ghostty. When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched
# or reloaded, Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions.
# If the permissions are not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS,
# you can find these permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security
# -> Accessibility.
# 
# On Linux, you need a desktop environment that implements the
# [Global Shortcuts](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.GlobalShortcuts.html)
# protocol as a part of its XDG desktop protocol implementation.
# Desktop environments that are known to support (or not support)
# global shortcuts include:
# 
#  - Users using KDE Plasma (since [5.27](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.27.0/#wayland))
#    and GNOME (since [48](https://release.gnome.org/48/#and-thats-not-all)) should be able
#    to use global shortcuts with little to no configuration.
# 
#  - Some manual configuration is required on Hyprland. Consult the steps
#    outlined on the [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/#dbus-global-shortcuts)
#    to set up global shortcuts correctly.
#    (Important: [`xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland/)
#    must also be installed!)
# 
#  - Notably, global shortcuts have not been implemented on wlroots-based
#    compositors like Sway (see [upstream issue](https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/issues/240)).

# Horizontal window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells
# and the left and right window borders. The value is in points, meaning that
# it will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
# 
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
# 
# To set a different left and right padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-x = 2,4` will set the
# left padding to 2 and the right padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-x = 2` will set both paddings to 2.
window-padding-x = 3

# The color of the padding area of the window. Valid values are:
# 
# * `background` - The background color specified in `background`.
# * `extend` - Extend the background color of the nearest grid cell.
# * `extend-always` - Same as "extend" but always extends without applying
#   any of the heuristics that disable extending noted below.
# 
# The "extend" value will be disabled in certain scenarios. On primary
# screen applications (e.g. not something like Neovim), the color will not
# be extended vertically if any of the following are true:
# 
# * The nearest row has any cells that have the default background color.
#   The thinking is that in this case, the default background color looks
#   fine as a padding color.
# * The nearest row is a prompt row (requires shell integration). The
#   thinking here is that prompts often contain powerline glyphs that
#   do not look good extended.
# * The nearest row contains a perfect fit powerline character. These
#   don't look good extended.
window-padding-color = extend

# The text that will be displayed in the subtitle of the window. Valid values:
# 
#   * `false` - Disable the subtitle.
#   * `working-directory` - Set the subtitle to the working directory of the
#      surface.
# 
# This feature is only supported on GTK.
# 
# Available since: 1.1.0
window-subtitle = working-directory

# The theme to use for the windows. Valid values:
# 
#   * `auto` - Determine the theme based on the configured terminal
#      background color. This has no effect if the "theme" configuration
#      has separate light and dark themes. In that case, the behavior
#      of "auto" is equivalent to "system".
#   * `system` - Use the system theme.
#   * `light` - Use the light theme regardless of system theme.
#   * `dark` - Use the dark theme regardless of system theme.
#   * `ghostty` - Use the background and foreground colors specified in the
#     Ghostty configuration. This is only supported on Linux builds.
# 
# On macOS, if `macos-titlebar-style` is `tabs` or `transparent`, the window theme will be
# automatically set based on the luminosity of the terminal background color.
# This only applies to terminal windows. This setting will still apply to
# non-terminal windows within Ghostty.
# 
# This is currently only supported on macOS and Linux.
window-theme = ghostty

# The position where new tabs are created. Valid values:
# 
#   * `current` - Insert the new tab after the currently focused tab,

# 
#   * `end` - Insert the new tab at the end of the tab list.

# This controls when resize overlays are shown. Resize overlays are a
# transient popup that shows the size of the terminal while the surfaces are
# being resized. The possible options are:
# 
#   * `always` - Always show resize overlays.
#   * `never` - Never show resize overlays.
#   * `after-first` - The resize overlay will not appear when the surface
#                     is first created, but will show up if the surface is
#                     subsequently resized.

# 
# This defaults to `true`. If set to `false`, surfaces will close without

# running.
confirm-close-surface = false

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", "tabs", and "hidden".
# 
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
# 
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
# 
# The "transparent" style will also update in real-time to dynamic
# changes to the window background color, e.g. via OSC 11. To make this
# more aesthetically pleasing, this only happens if the terminal is
# a window, tab, or split that borders the top of the window. This
# avoids a disjointed appearance where the titlebar color changes
# but all the topmost terminals don't match.
# 
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
# 
# The "hidden" style hides the titlebar. Unlike `window-decoration = false`,
# however, it does not remove the frame from the window or cause it to have
# squared corners. Changing to or from this option at run-time may affect
# existing windows in buggy ways.
# 
# When "hidden", the top titlebar area can no longer be used for dragging
# the window. To drag the window, you can use option+click on the resizable
# areas of the frame to drag the window. This is a standard macOS behavior
# and not something Ghostty enables.
# 
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
# 
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.
macos-titlebar-style = tabs

# macOS doesn't have a distinct "alt" key and instead has the "option"
# key which behaves slightly differently. On macOS by default, the
# option key plus a character will sometimes produce a Unicode character.
# For example, on US standard layouts option-b produces "∫". This may be
# undesirable if you want to use "option" as an "alt" key for keybindings
# in terminal programs or shells.
# 
# This configuration lets you change the behavior so that option is treated
# as alt.
# 
# The default behavior (unset) will depend on your active keyboard
# layout. If your keyboard layout is one of the keyboard layouts listed
# below, then the default value is "true". Otherwise, the default
# value is "false". Keyboard layouts with a default value of "true" are:
# 
#   - U.S. Standard
#   - U.S. International
# 
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (e.g. `alt+ctrl+a`).
# 
# Explicit values that can be set:
# 
# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key.
# 
# You may set this to `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode
# sequences but this will break terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
# 
# The values `left` or `right` enable this for the left or right *Option*
# key, respectively.
macos-option-as-alt = true

# If `true`, the Ghostty GTK application will run in single-instance mode:
# each new `ghostty` process launched will result in a new window if there is
# already a running process.
# 
# If `false`, each new ghostty process will launch a separate application.
# 
# If `detect`, Ghostty will assume true (single instance) unless one of
# the following scenarios is found:
# 
# 1. TERM_PROGRAM environment variable is a non-empty value. In this
# case, we assume Ghostty is being launched from a graphical terminal
# session and you want a dedicated instance.
# 
# 2. Any CLI arguments exist. In this case, we assume you are passing
# custom Ghostty configuration. Single instance mode inherits the
# configuration from when it was launched, so we must disable single
# instance to load the new configuration.
# 
# If either of these scenarios is producing a false positive, you can
# set this configuration explicitly to the behavior you want.
# 
# The pre-1.2 option `desktop` has been deprecated. Please replace
# this with `detect`.
# 
# The default value is `detect`.
# 
# Note that debug builds of Ghostty have a separate single-instance ID
# so you can test single instance without conflicting with release builds.
gtk-single-instance = true

# Determines the appearance of the top and bottom bars tab bar.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `flat` - Top and bottom bars are flat with the terminal window.

#  * `raised-border` - Similar to `raised` but the shadow is replaced with a
#    more subtle border.
gtk-toolbar-style = flat

# The release channel to use for auto-updates.
# 
# The default value of this matches the release channel of the currently
# running Ghostty version. If you download a pre-release version of Ghostty
# then this will be set to `tip` and you will receive pre-release updates.
# If you download a stable version of Ghostty then this will be set to
# `stable` and you will receive stable updates.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `stable` - Stable, tagged releases such as "1.0.0".
#  * `tip` - Pre-release versions generated from each commit to the
#    main branch. This is the version that was in use during private
#    beta testing by thousands of people. It is generally stable but
#    will likely have more bugs than the stable channel.
# 
# Changing this configuration requires a full restart of
# Ghostty to take effect.
# 
# This only works on macOS since only macOS has an auto-update feature.
